> Khmer Rouge is the name that was popularly given to members of the 
> Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), and by extension to Democratic Kampuchea, 
> which ruled the country between 1975 and 1979. 
> 
> The name was coined in the 1960s by Norodom Sihanouk 
> to describe his country's heterogeneous, communist-led dissidents, 
> with whom he allied after the 1970 Cambodian coup d'état.
>
> The Kampuchea Revolutionary Army was slowly built up in the forests of eastern Cambodia 
> during the late 1960s, supported by the People's Army of Vietnam, the Viet Cong, 
> the Pathet Lao, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). 
> 
> Although it originally fought against Sihanouk, the Khmer Rouge changed its position 
> and supported Sihanouk following the CCP's advice 
> after he was overthrown in a 1970 coup d'état by Lon Nol 
> who established the pro-American Khmer Republic. 
> 
> Despite a massive American bombing campaign (Operation Freedom Deal) against them, 
> the Khmer Rouge won the Cambodian Civil War when they captured the Cambodian capital 
> and overthrew the Khmer Republic in 1975. 
> 
> Following their victory, the Khmer Rouge—who were led by Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary, Son Sen, and Khieu Samphan—immediately set about forcibly evacuating the country's major cities. 
> In 1976, they renamed the country Democratic Kampuchea.
>
> The Khmer Rouge regime was highly autocratic, totalitarian, and repressive. 
> Many deaths resulted from the regime's social engineering policies and the "Moha Lout Plaoh", 
> an imitation of China's Great Leap Forward which had caused the Great Chinese Famine. 
> 
> The Khmer Rouge's attempts at agricultural reform through collectivization 
> similarly led to widespread famine, while its insistence on absolute self-sufficiency, 
> including the supply of medicine, led to the death of many thousands from treatable diseases, such as malaria.
>
> The Khmer Rouge regime murdered hundreds of thousands of perceived political opponents, 
> and their racist emphasis on national purity resulted in the genocide of Cambodian minorities. 
> Its cadres summarily executed and tortured perceived subversive elements, 
> or they killed them during genocidal purges of their own ranks between 1975 and 1979. 
> 
> Ultimately, the Cambodian genocide which took place under the Khmer Rouge regime 
> led to the deaths of 1.5 to 2 million people, around 25% of Cambodia's population.
>
> In the 1970s, the Khmer Rouge was largely supported and funded by the CCP, 
> receiving approval from CCP Chairman Mao Zedong; 
> it is estimated that at least 90% of the foreign aid which was provided to the Khmer Rouge 
> came from China. 
> 
> The regime was removed from power in 1979 when Vietnam invaded Cambodia 
> and quickly destroyed most of its forces. 
> 
> The Khmer Rouge then fled to Thailand, 
> whose government saw them as a buffer force against the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). 
> The Khmer Rouge continued to fight against the Vietnamese 
> and the government of the new People's Republic of Kampuchea 
> until the end of the war in 1989. 
> 
> The Cambodian governments-in-exile (including the Khmer Rouge) 
> held onto Cambodia's United Nations seat (with considerable international support) until 1993, 
> when the monarchy was restored and the name of the Cambodian state was changed 
> to the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
> A year later, thousands of Khmer Rouge guerrillas surrendered themselves in a government amnesty.
>
> In 1996, a new political party called the Democratic National Union Movement 
> was formed by Ieng Sary, who was granted amnesty, 
> despite his role as the deputy leader of the Khmer Rouge, 
> in exchange for his defection and his role in persuading other Khmer Rouge fighters to surrender. 
> This move helped to further dissolve the Khmer Rouge organization 
> and was a calculated political decision to end the ongoing civil war 
> by incorporating former resistance leaders. 
> 
> The Khmer Rouge was largely dissolved by the mid-1990s 
> and finally surrendered completely in 1999. 
> 
> Ieng Sary was arrested in 2007 and was charged with crimes against humanity 
> but died of heart failure before the case against him could be brought to a verdict. 
> In 2014, two Khmer Rouge leaders, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, were jailed for life 
> by the United Nations-backed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, 
> which found them guilty of crimes against humanity for their roles in the Khmer Rouge's genocidal campaign.
